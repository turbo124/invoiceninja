      Attempts to authenticate with the API using a email/password combination.
    
      After authenticating with the API, the returned object is a CompanyUser object which is a bridge linking the user to the company. 

      The company user object contains the users permissions (admin/owner or fine grained permissions) You will most likely want to 
        also include in the response of this object both the company and the user object, this can be done by using the include parameter.

      ```html
      /api/v1/login?include=company,user

      The Clients API provides endpoints for managing client records within your company. A client represents a customer 
      or business entity that you provide services or products to.

      ## Key Features
      - Create, read, update, and delete client records
      - Manage client contact information and billing details
      - View client-specific transaction history
      - Handle multiple contacts per client
      - Track client-specific settings and preferences

      ## Client Statuses
      - Active: Client is currently active and can be billed
      - Archived: Client is archived and hidden from active lists
      - Deleted: Client is marked for deletion but retained in the database

      ## Best Practices
      - Always validate client email addresses
      - Use unique client numbers for easy reference
      - Keep contact information up to date
      - Set appropriate client-specific currency and tax settings

      ## Invoice Statuses
      
      - STATUS_DRAFT = 1
        - Draft invoices are not visible in the client portal, are not active and they do not impact the client balance
      - STATUS_SENT = 2
        - Send invoices are visible in the client portal, are active and impact the client balance
      - STATUS_PARTIAL = 3
        - An invoice which has been partially paid
      - STATUS_PAID = 4
        - An invoice which has been fully paid
      - STATUS_CANCELLED = 5
        - When a invoice is cancelled the invoice balance is set to zero and the status updated to Cancelled, the client balance is also adjusted down. If payments have been applied to the invoice these will remain linked to the invoice
      - STATUS_REVERSED = 6
        - When a invoice has been reversed, the previous payments relationships are unlinked and cannot be restored
      - STATUS_OVERDUE = -1
        - An invoice which is still payable past its due date
      - STATUS_UNPAID = -2
        - An invoice which is not yet due, but also, not paid
